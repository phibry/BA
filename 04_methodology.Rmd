## 3. Methodology

The focus of this thesis can be divided into two areas. First, the aim is to find an optimal neural network including a network architecture. This should perform well in the application area, in which the future log return of the Bitcoin is predicted on the basis of historical log returns. In a second step, we will focus on defining a trading strategy based on our findings. All considerations and findings will be presented in a quantitative way and compared with each other. Figure \ref{fig:flowchart_overview} helps to get an overview of the individual steps followed in this chapter.

### 3.1. Data exploration {#data_exploration}

The data in this paper is accessed  through the API of Yahoo Finance and is originally provided by the price-tracking website CoinMarketCap. We use the daily closing price of bitcoin in USD with the ticker BTC-USD. As cryptocurrencies are traded 24/7, the closing price refers to the last price of the day evaluated at the last time stamp according to the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

In chapter [2.3.](#bitcoin), the bitcoin price and the logarithmic price is visualized.
For processing and analyzing the data in order to fulfill the weak stationarity assumptions, we transform the data into log returns according to equation \ref{eq:logreturn}.

```{=tex}
\begin{align} \label{eq:logreturn}
\mathrm{LogReturn} = \mathrm{log}(x_{t})-\mathrm{log}(x_{t-1})
\end{align}
```

```{r log_ret, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="logreturns BTC",out.width="80%"}
load("data/log_ret_27_03_21.rda");log_ret=    log_ret_27_03_21   # loading logreturns
df_sub <- data.frame(date = ymd(time(log_ret)), value = as.numeric(log_ret))
plot(df_sub,
     type="l",
     frame.plot = FALSE,
     xaxt="n",
     xlab="",
     ylab="Log Return", ylim=c(-0.45, 0.2))
axis.Date(1, at=seq(min(df_sub$date), max(df_sub$date), by="months"), format="%m-%y")
```

Figure \ref{fig:log_ret} displays the historical log returns. In addition to the volatility clusters typical for financial time series, large outliers are visible. The negative outlier at the beginning of 2020 is particularly noticeable. By computing the autocorrelation (ACF) of the series in figure \ref{fig:acf_log_ret}, we can describe the dependency in these clusters. According to the ACF the lags 6 and 10 are significant on a 5% level. 

```{r acf_log_ret, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Autocorrelation of bitcoin log returns"}
# acf(log_ret,main="autocorrelation Logreturns")
chart.ACF(log_ret,main="Autocorrelation of log returns", maxlag = 20)
```

Curios from which distribution the log returns might originate, we are fitting a normal distribution and a Students-t distribution to the data in Figure \ref{fig:histogramm_logreturns}.

Interestingly the mean is shifted slightly (0.002) to the positive side. By inspecting the tails, one can observe that the negative tail is not fitted as good as the positive part by the t distribution. The two normal distributions either over- or underestimate the values in the tails, therefore we conclude that the proposed t-distribution fits the data better but also not perfect.

Pointing at the extreme outlier discussed earlier, visible in figure \ref{fig:log_ret} towards the end, the density plot makes clear how unimaginable small the probability of this extreme observation is.

### 3.2. Network architecture

As mentioned in chapter [2.1.3.](#MLP), choosing an appropriate network architecture for bitcoin price prediction is a crucial step in order to achieve useful forecasts while avoiding overfitting. Due to the complexity as well as the non-linearity of neural networks, the interpretation cannot be performed intuitively. For this reason, an approach is pursued in which neural networks with different numbers of layers and neurons are compared with each other by using the MSE loss and Sharpe ratio. This allows us to compare accuracy, respectively trading performance and possibly see a connection with network architecture.

To find the optimal network architecture, we test a maximum of 3 layers with a maximum of 10 neurons each. More complex models are not included in this thesis, as this would exceed the time frame. Furthermore, the application of complex network architectures for financial time series can be expected to lead to overfitting and thus to no real added value. The simplest network has one layer with one neuron (1), while the most complex has 3 layers with 10 neurons each (10,10,10). The total number of different combinations can be expressed as follows:

```{=tex}
\begin{align} \label{eq:comb}
\text{comb}=\sum_{i=1}^{L}N^{i}
\end{align}
```
with:

$L=\text{maximum Layer} \in \mathbb{N}^{*}$

$N=\text{maximum Neuron}\in \mathbb{N}^{*}$

$\text{comb} =\text{Number of all combinations}$

Thus, with our initial setup, we obtain a maximum neuron-layer combination of 1110. To respond to the challenges mentioned in section [2.1.6.](#challenges), not only a single network per neuron-layer combination is trained, but a whole batch of 50 networks. So we end up with a total of 55'500 trained networks. For each individual network, the in-sample and out-of-sample MSE as well as the Sharpe ratios are determined. We use these values to find an optimal network architecture based on the statistical error as well as on the trading performance (daily trading).

Finally, to ensure that the network architecture does not perform only for the selected time frame, the in-sample and out-of-sample split as well as the time period is discussed. 

\newpage

#### 3.2.1. Defining train and test samples
&nbsp;

We are looking for an optimal network, the optimal network should also provide reasonable and reliable predictions for different periods. For further analysis, we use a subset of the introduced closing prices of the bitcoin. Starting from the first of January 2020 to the 27th of March in 2021, we only consider 15 months for our data.

The reason for doing so is, we donâ€™t believe that the historical data longer than a year consists any information about the price tomorrow. By optimizing our models we found that more data would bring no additional performance, therefore the selected subset should be sufficient.
As proposed in [@nn_trading] we choose a test train split from 6 months in-sample and 1 month out-of-sample. This split is applied to the whole subset in form of a rolling window. By stepping forward with this 6/1 split by steplength of one month we end up with 9 data splits in total. In figure \ref{fig:test_train} this procedure is visualized, for every new timestep a new month is considered for the out of sample and the first month of the in sample, falls out of the frame.

```{r test_train, out.width='80%', fig.cap='Distribution of Logreturns', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/test_train_split_pp.jpeg.jpg")
```

In the time series in figure \ref{fig:test_train}, one can see different periods. Strongly volatile as well as rather calm phases occur. With the rolling window, we can train and test the networks based on different phases. Thus, we can also evaluate the performance of the networks based on different phases and not only on a predefined single test and train split.

The complexity of the search for the optimal network architecture increases significantly here. With the conditions defined for us, we train and test a total number of 499'500 networks to define the optimal network.

\newpage

#### 3.2.2.  Evaluating network architecture
&nbsp;

In this chapter, we would like to focus on some findings that we discovered during the processing of the trained networks. To illustrate the results, the 5th train/test split is discussed.
Here we would like to focus on some findings that we discovered during the processing of the trained networks. To illustrate the results, an extract is discussed here, namely only the 5th train/test split (in figure \ref{fig:test_train} the middle one).

The plot in figure \ref{fig:mse_plot1} compares one layer networks with different numbers of neurons with each other . Networks with a maximum of ten neurons are compared. These different configurations can be seen on the x-axis. The first data point corresponds to a simple network with one neuron. The y-axis shows the MSE values obtained with the respective trained model. As already explained, we use 50 different optimizations of each configuration to get a better idea of a potentially systematic relationship with the MSE. In the plot, each of the 50 configurations is drawn using a different color.

```{r mse_plot1, out.width='100%', fig.cap='Fifth train/test split, 1 layer with 10 different networks.', echo=FALSE,fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/batch5/mse_5_layer1.jpeg")
```

What is already noticeable here is that with increasing complexity, i.e. with increasing number of neurons, the in-sample MSE decreases. The in-sample forcasts are thus becoming more accurate. At the same time, you can see how the out-of-sample MSE increases with increasing complexity, which means that the forecast accuracy tends to get worse.

Such a 

\newpage

If you add another layer to the network architecture, the number of different networks with the same number of layers also increases. In the following figure \ref{fig:mse_plot2}, the simplest network is a (1,1) network. So 2 layers with one neuron each. The most complex is a network with a (10,10) architecture.

As noted earlier in figure \ref{fig:mse_plot1}, the values for the MSE also fluctuate more and more with increasing complexity. Small in-sample MSE for more complex networks lead to rather high out-of-sample MSE. This leads us to the previously mentioned challenges in section [2.1.6.1.](#overfitting), and that is that too many estimated parameters can lead to overfitting of the network.

```{r mse_plot2, out.width='100%', fig.cap='Fifth train/test split, 2 layers with 100 different networks.', echo=FALSE,fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/batch5/mse_5_layer2.jpeg")
```

Looking at the out-of-sample MSE's in the graph below in figure \ref{fig:mse_plot2}, we can see lines that are outside of the blue rectangle. These values are extreme outliers that indicate the randomness of neural networks. This again confirms that choosing an optimal network over several equal networks (50 in our case) makes more sense than making the choice depend on only one randomly trained network. Depending on which solution the training algorithm finds, the results can be very different. The y-axis was scaled for better comparability of in-sample and out-of-sample, but one loses the overview of how much the outliers differ from the rest.

\newpage

Lastly, we look at the results of the different network architectures with a third layer. In figure \ref{fig:mse_plot3}, we can see very well the inverse correlation between the in-sample and out-of-sample MSE. Again, the in-sample MSE gets better with increasing complexity while the out-of-sample MSE gets worse. There is also a certain recurring pattern that is striking. After a certain complexity, the in-sample MSE decreases steadily and then increases abruptly. The opposite pattern can also be observed out-of-sample. These patterns emerge during transitions from more complex to more simple architectures. For example, the transition from a model with (8,10,10), with a total of 28 neurons, to a model with (9,1,1) with only 11 neurons.

It is interesting that at the beginning, with the rather simple model architectures, the MSE of all realizations is very constant and only varies very slightly.

BESPIEL: Man hat 9 Splits Ã  je 1110 Neuronen-Layer-Kombinationen. FÃ¼r jede NL-Architektur wurden 50 neuronale Netzwerke trainiert. Somit kommt man auf 55500 Netze pro Splits. Also fÃ¼r alleine diese Versuchreihe wurden 499500 Netzwerke trainiert. Nun mÃ¶chte man diejenige NL-Architektur finden, welche im Verlauf der Zeit (Verlauf der 9 Splits) am besten geblieben/am wenigsten an Performanz verloren hat/am besten geworden ist finden. Man hat herausgefunden, dass Netzte sehr zufÃ¤llig sind. Somit werden die Mittelwerte Ã¼ber die 50 Netzte pro Layer, pro Split gebildet. Man erhÃ¤lt fÃ¼r jede NL-Kombination 9 verschiedene Mittelwerte der MSEs. Die Suche nach einer optimalen Netzwerk-Architektur ist so um einiges einfacher. (siehe \ref{fig:mse_mean})
