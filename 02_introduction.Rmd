## 1. Introduction

The well-known asset classes such as equities, bonds and money market instruments have existed for several decades and have established themselves as a fixed component in many portfolios. The approach often taken is that, in principle, the equity component is responsible for the main return and the remaining asset classes are used to optimize the risk/return ratio or, depending on the area of application, for liquidity. Recently, there has been talk of a new asset class that has a low correlation to the equity markets, very high volatility, but also enormous opportunities for profit [@bitcoin_market]. The best-known cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization at the moment is bitcoin. Compared to traditional asset classes, the characteristics of the bitcoin market are relatively unexplored. Especially for the reason that only about ten years of  historical data is available for bitcoin. In addition to this aspect, the costs for trading bitcoin are surprisingly low and are in the promille range when using exchanges like Binance or Kraken. These characteristics make bitcoin an attractive investment vehicle to test the application of artificial neural networks. In this sense, this thesis investigates how the use of feedforward neural networks with their non-linear properties can be used to build a profitable trading strategy. Two central questions are pursued:

1) What influence does the selection of the network architecture have on the quality of predictions? What influence can be found with respect to the Sharpe ratio of a simple trading strategy?

2) What is the added value of enhancing this neural network with aspects of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)? Again, the impact on trading performance will be investigated. 

To investigate these aspects, the first step is to try to find an optimal network architecture. For this purpose, all possible combinations between the simplest model (one layer and one neuron) and the most complex model (three layers and ten neurons) are tested and the results quantified using the common error function mean squared error (MSE) and the Sharpe ratio. Unlike linear regression, the neural network cannot be intuitively explained by the partial effects because it behaves non-linearly. Therefore, the linear parameter data (LPD) method is used to investigate how the network behaves with input stimuli. Furthermore, the volatility clusters typical for financial time series are investigated and evaluated with a simple GARCH model. The question is whether the addition of these information results in an added value for our trading strategy. 

We believe that the examination of neural networks in the field of (crypto-)finance is of great importance. The benefits of deep learning have already been proven in many applications outside this field. Ever since Siri was launched by Apple Inc. in 2011, people outside the world of science began to have a rough idea of what artificial intelligence is. Although the application of neural networks in the use case of Siri and natural language processing (NLP) seems reasonable, the opinion is split in the application in the field of financial time series. Since a large part of movements of financial instruments are based on white noise and thus have almost no dependency structure, the implementation of a meaningful method is challenging. Likewise, integration of neural networks only makes sense if a comprehensible and systematically replicable overperformance can be achieved. This bachelor thesis deals exactly with this topic. The application of neural networks for the prediction and trading of Bitcoin is investigated. Aspects of XAI and volatility modeling are included to possibly shed some light on this black box.
