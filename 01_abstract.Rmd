## Abstract

The steady worldwide growth of machine learning methods is becoming increasingly important also concerning the financial markets. However, these methods are mostly still very opaque. This thesis deals with the application of neural networks, their explainability, and the trading of Bitcoin, which is considered the founder of the youngest asset class called cryptocurrency. The theory of the neural networks used and the novel explainability aspect is explained, furthermore, there is a brief insight into the Bitcoin theory. As a first approach, an optimal network architecture is determined through computational power to optimize accurate predictions for the daily trading of Bitcoin. With the explainability aspect and a prediction for the volatility with a GARCH model, a rule for trading is implemented and then improved with the addition of the cryptocurrency Ether, which is based on the Ethereum blockchain. The results are promising, explainability brings a significant added value, and the almost unbeatable benchmark buy and hold can be outperformed.
